VO_Archive_Sampo_1.ogg  ||  Hey, (Trailblazer)! Y'know, with Sampo Koski by your side, you've got a businessman, chaperon, and problem-solving conversationalist, all rolled into one! Pretty sweet deal, huh?
VO_Archive_Sampo_2.ogg  ||  So, what's the job this time around? If you've got the cash, I've got the... No cash? N—Not a problem! Haha, just say the word, pal...
VO_Archive_Sampo_3.ogg  ||  Come on, get some rest already! What's the matter? I'm not going anywhere.
VO_Archive_Sampo_5.ogg  ||  Me? I'm just an easygoing fella that looks out for the little guy — free of charge I might add — who somehow gets pulled into everyone else's business with nothing to show for it! Tsk, like I say, I'm an easygoing fella.
VO_Archive_Sampo_4.ogg  ||  If you package it right, you can sell the same piece of intel to different people! That, my friend, is called "maximizing your profit."
VO_Archive_Sampo_6.ogg  ||  I'm a firm believer in "small talk brings big clients."
VO_Archive_Sampo_7.ogg  ||  I sell things that buyers want to buy — and they call me a con man! It's outrageous!
VO_Archive_Sampo_15.ogg  ||  You'd think in a place as isolated as Belobog, people would be more willing to share what they have. Well, it's the exact opposite. And I'm more than happy to make up the shortfall.
VO_Archive_Sampo_16.ogg  ||  Come on, how did you guys end up in the middle of the Snow Plains? UFO? Let me guess, you took a train, haha. Seriously though.
VO_Archive_Sampo_8.ogg  ||  Back when I first arrived in the Underworld, I used to bring Natasha the medicines she needed. I did that for a while, and before long it was medicines and intel. You know how these things work.
VO_Archive_Sampo_9.ogg  ||  If anyone out there ever managed to strike a deal with Svarog, they'd earn my heartfelt admiration!
VO_Archive_Sampo_10.ogg  ||  Our little girl in red is truly impressive. How did she get that giant tinhead to listen to her?
VO_Archive_Sampo_11.ogg  ||  If she had it her way, Miss Seele would spend less time yelling at me and more time actively trying to hit me. Can someone explain what I did to deserve her?
VO_Archive_Sampo_12.ogg  ||  Ah, we see each other pretty often — usually it's me running away and him running after me. Gotta say, I'm gradually beginning to enjoy the attention, hehe.
VO_Archive_Sampo_13.ogg  ||  We used to be good pals, but now... Let's just say her brother put in a bad word for me.
VO_Archive_Sampo_14.ogg  ||  My only wish is to get acquainted with the supreme guardian-to-be. Any introduction will do — even a painful one!
VO_Archive_Sampo_17.ogg  ||  Have you seen him compete? A lot of Underworlders made a lot of money off that kid! *sigh* Your pal Sampo here wasn't one of them...
Special:Upload?wpDestFile=VO_Archive_Sampo_18.ogg  ||  Everyone has a colorful past, wouldn't you say...?
VO_Archive_Sampo_19.ogg  ||  Double the pay, double the service!
VO_Archive_Sampo_25.ogg  ||  Ha! Always an honor to have the Trailblazer by my side!
VO_Sampo_Battle_Begins_-_Weakness_Break_01.ogg  ||  Sampo Koski always takes care of his friends.
VO_Sampo_Battle_Begins_-_Danger_Alert_01.ogg  ||  Good! The stronger the better.
VO_Sampo_Turn_Begins_01.ogg  ||  We're just having fun.
VO_Sampo_Turn_Begins_02.ogg  ||  Sounds like more business knocking.
VO_Sampo_Turn_Idling_01.ogg  ||  Can we bring out the big guns already?
VO_Sampo_Skill_01.ogg  ||  Try this on for size?
VO_Sampo_Hit_by_Light_Attack_01.ogg  ||  Ooh, ouch...
VO_Sampo_Hit_by_Heavy_Attack_01.ogg  ||  Hey! W-Watch the face!
VO_Sampo_Ultimate_-_Activate_01.ogg  ||  What are you waiting for?
VO_Sampo_Ultimate_-_Unleash_01.ogg  ||  The customer is king, and for me to betray the king, well... You gotta make it worth my while.
VO_Sampo_Downed_01.ogg  ||  This price was too steep...
VO_Sampo_Return_to_Battle_01.ogg  ||  One good turn deserves another.
VO_Sampo_Health_Recovery_01.ogg  ||  I owe you one~
VO_Sampo_Technique_01.ogg  ||  Heehee~
VO_Sampo_Battle_Won_01.ogg  ||  How're you gonna win if you don't take any risks?
VO_Sampo_Treasure_Opening_01.ogg  ||  No cash?
VO_Sampo_Treasure_Opening_02.ogg  ||  You like it? It's yours for the taking!
VO_Sampo_Successful_Puzzle-Solving_01.ogg  ||  Hey now! Pretty good.
VO_Sampo_Successful_Puzzle-Solving_02.ogg  ||  Solving people's problems is my specialty~!
VO_Sampo_Enemy_Target_Found_01.ogg  ||  I dunno — this one looks kinda tough...
VO_Sampo_Returning_to_Town_01.ogg  ||  Wherever there is business, there is Sampo.
