VO_Archive_Gepard_5.ogg  ||  As a Silvermane Guard, I observe the oath not because I fear to go against it, but because I am obliged to uphold it.
VO_Archive_Gepard_4.ogg  ||  Belobog is far from buried in the snow curtain. This city is the planet's last bastion against the ferocity of the Eternal Freeze.
VO_Archive_Gepard_6.ogg  ||  I grow flowers, *sigh* ...It's just that I'm not very good at it.
VO_Archive_Gepard_7.ogg  ||  My sister's songs are very popular among the Guards — there's always someone singing one when we're off duty. Recently I've found myself humming them without realizing, even when I'm on duty... *sigh*
VO_Archive_Gepard_13.ogg  ||  The Landau family has had the honor and responsibility of serving the supreme guardians for generations. Only by becoming a shield for the people is one worthy of the title "Architect."

VO_Archive_Gepard_11.ogg  ||  I've always firmly believed that no one knows this city better or loves it more than the supreme guardian.
VO_Archive_Gepard_12.ogg  ||  He's very... cunning. According to leads provided by citizens, he's got his hands on a number of ancient relics. He sold off most of them, but it seems he's using others to commit various frauds.
VO_Archive_Gepard_15.ogg  ||  My little sister has a... peculiar streak. No, no, I don't mean a bad temper... *sigh* Let's just say she reminds me more of Serval than me.
