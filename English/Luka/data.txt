VO_Archive_Luka_1.ogg  ||  Oh, hey! I'm Luka, a member of Wildfire. Roughing up thugs and protecting the townsfolk is just part of my everyday job.
VO_Archive_Luka_2.ogg  ||  The tournament's starting? Great! Let me get warmed up.
VO_Archive_Luka_3.ogg  ||  Need a rest? Go! Tell you a secret though — a champion wins by training hard while others rest.
VO_Archive_Luka_4.ogg  ||  I don't fight because I like violence, or want to win the championship, or to show off to anyone... I just think there are too many thugs in the Underworld and the kids need a good example.
VO_Archive_Luka_5.ogg  ||  My master said: Try not to think too much about what you lost — think more about what you gained. Every time I look at my arm, I remember those words.
VO_Archive_Luka_6.ogg  ||  The Overworld? Not really interested. Unless, of course, there's a worthy opponent up there, or a bully that needs a good lesson.
VO_Archive_Luka_7.ogg  ||  A popular Fight Club motto: "Make friends with the one who hurts you the most..." No wonder everyone wants to be my friend!
VO_Archive_Luka_8.ogg  ||  Vegetables... mushrooms... disgusting. Why is it whenever there's an extinction, it's never these things?
VO_Archive_Luka_9.ogg  ||  Have you heard of the three wonders of the Underworld? Geomarrow, heartless supervisors, and Luka's fist of steel!
VO_Archive_Luka_10.ogg  ||  It's hard to believe, but there are folks willing to spend their whole lives putting hammer to iron or pickaxe to stone... I know, I know — not everyone has the opportunity to follow their dreams... but without dreams, I don't think I'd have made it this far.
VO_Archive_Luka_11.ogg  ||  Unless my injuries are serious, I try my best not to bother Natasha. Too many people need her help, they shouldn't have to suffer for my carelessness.
VO_Archive_Luka_12.ogg  ||  Seele... Now, how can I coax her into joining the tournament? With her strength, she'll easily be crowned champion... unless she meets me! Ha!
VO_Archive_Luka_13.ogg  ||  Gotta find an opportunity to beat that tinhead in an arm wrestle... Huh? You thought I was serious? Well, maybe the right arm...
VO_Archive_Luka_14.ogg  ||  I don't need a middleman. Plus, anyone who calls themself "tall, blue, and handsome" definitely can't be trusted.
VO_Archive_Luka_15.ogg  ||  Everyone says Hook is too naughty, but I think she's a good kid. An example? Uh... guess I don't have any — just my gut feeling. Tsk, what do you mean "spoken like a true honorary member of The Moles"!?
VO_Archive_Luka_16.ogg  ||  ...Oh, uh, never mind — I was just wondering how much training I've got left before I can finally beat Master Oleg. I need to hurry up — if he gets too old it won't be impressive anymore!
VO_Archive_Luka_17.ogg  ||  Niiiice, let's go!
Special:Upload?wpDestFile=VO_Archive_Luka_18.ogg  ||  Why train daily when you could train twice daily?
VO_Archive_Luka_20.ogg  ||  Very practical. Nice call!
VO_Luka_Precious_Treasure_Opening_01.ogg  ||  Now that's what I'm talking about!
