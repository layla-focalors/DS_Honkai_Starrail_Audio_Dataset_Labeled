VO_Archive_Huohuo_1.ogg  ||  Huohuo: H—Hello, I'm Huohuo, the newly appointed judge of the Ten-Lords Commission. Um... what else should I mention...
Tail: Ahem... Uh, Hello? Don't forget to introduce the most famous heliobus of all.
Huohuo: Ah, yes — Tail! This is Tail!
VO_Archive_Huohuo_2.ogg  ||  Huohuo: H—Hello! Uh, I mean... Well, I... I guess I'll take my leave now. B—Bye...
Tail: You were supposed to say hi, not bye!
VO_Archive_Huohuo_3.ogg  ||  F—Finally, time to go home. I hope no one notices me.
VO_Archive_Huohuo_4.ogg  ||  I—I tried to turn this job down... It just doesn't feel fair — asking someone with heliophobia to hunt down heliobi with a heliobus? *sigh* They told me it was to "conquer my fear..."
VO_Archive_Huohuo_5.ogg  ||  Huohuo: My tail was consumed during a heliobus attack — the rest of me barely got away. It's a good job the Ten-Lords Commission sealed the demon in my tail before it had the chance to finish me off...
Tail: It's not my fault that Foxians have the most scrumptious tails... However, now that I'm a tail, I've realized all sorts of monsters want to have me for breakfast!
VO_Archive_Huohuo_6.ogg  ||  I can use this banner to dispel demons... but it also comes in handy when signaling my surrender...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_7.ogg  ||  Huohuo: I make paper dolls whenever I get the chance. With so many little "friends" around, there's nothing to fear...
Tail: Don't get me started! Those things stress me out. The mere thought of seeing a smiling paper doll right in front of my face in the middle of the night...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_8.ogg  ||  I practice my bravery by watching horror-comedies late at night. When it gets to a scary part, I laugh it off like this... Hehehehehehehe! So, yeah...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_9.ogg  ||  Huohuo: The owner of The Looking Bronze said I have a knack for attracting evil. I—I have a vague idea why that is...
Tail: Apparently, I am that "vague idea". Be that as it may, your tendency to trip over yourself is entirely your own fault.
VO_Archive_Huohuo_10.ogg  ||  How do I relax? I like to find a place in Starskiff Haven to lay back and watch the starskiffs come and go... although my colleagues say it works better for insomnia... A—Anyway, you should try it.
VO_Archive_Huohuo_11.ogg  ||  I heard a lot of heliobi were sealed in the Artisanship Commission's Creation Furnace, but they all escaped when the furnace broke... That's why my workload is the way it is...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_12.ogg  ||  Little Gui? She has a lot of yang energy — she dispels bad luck very easily. Even my tail goes quiet when she's around. The only drawback is I have to raise my voice around her if I wanted to be heard...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_13.ogg  ||  Huohuo: The puppet judge? She really scared me at first... but when Tail threatened her, she didn't bat an eyelid. Madam Xueyi is amazing — I really want to be like her one day...
Tail: Amazing!? Let's see if she still has that smirk on her face when I burn the Ten-Lords Commission to the ground!
VO_Archive_Huohuo_14.ogg  ||  In order to differentiate between the sisters, I call her the rambling judge... *gasp* She hasn't found out, has she?
VO_Archive_Huohuo_15.ogg  ||  It seems like Qingque is always on a break. When I'm relaxing, she's relaxing, and when I get swamped with work, guess what...? She's still relaxing! I guess the Divination Commission has a pretty light workload...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_16.ogg  ||  Huohuo: B—Be more determined? I usually just want to run away... Still, every time I try, Mr. Tail sends me straight back to the enemies' doorstep. *sigh* Why can't he just leave me be...?
Tail: Hmph! Fine by me! If you get swallowed whole, I'll finally be able to break free!
VO_Archive_Huohuo_17.ogg  ||  People say that the general's portrait can be used to dispel evil. I tried but... useless... I—I mean the portrait, not the general. I shouldn't have believed in such superstitious nonsense.
VO_Archive_Huohuo_18.ogg  ||  I wonder if the Dragon Lady has any "brave pills" for sale... If not, "play dead pills" might do the trick...
VO_Archive_Huohuo_19.ogg  ||  How come Madam Yukong has an air of authority, but I don't? I mean, we're both Foxians. Actually... I know why, but I can't help being a little envious.
VO_Archive_Huohuo_20.ogg  ||  Actually, we met a long time ago. I was outside getting some peace and quiet, when all of a sudden she dragged me before the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery. She mistook me for a missing person...
Special:Upload?wpDestFile=VO_Archive_Huohuo_Eidolon_Activation.ogg  ||  So this is the life of a cursed one...
