VO_Archive_Herta_2.ogg  ||  Why not come around today and help me with my research? You'll be the subject, by the way.
VO_Archive_Herta_3.ogg  ||  *sigh* I've lost interest in your research potential for today. See you tomorrow.

VO_Archive_Herta_7.ogg  ||  Best not to ponder, you'll be scratching your chin all day.
VO_Archive_Herta_4.ogg  ||  The good thing about this club is that it doesn't ask me for anything. In fact, it doesn't even care if I'm a member.
VO_Archive_Herta_5.ogg  ||  Why do I get to visit an Aeon? I'm Herta, that's why.
VO_Archive_Herta_8.ogg  ||  If you're not solving problems or writing up contributions, then don't blame me if your life is boring.
VO_Archive_Herta_9.ogg  ||  I'm perfect enough already. What else do I need to prove? Of course, I could write a few more books... but what would I get out of that? Why should I bother?
VO_Archive_Herta_13.ogg  ||  The Intelligentsia Guild is always able to find a way to support their case, writing enough "scholarship" in one night to fill a library... This is a problem.

VO_Archive_Herta_10.ogg  ||  Asta provided financial assistance to a few exceptional children — I assume Arlan was one of them.
VO_Archive_Herta_11.ogg  ||  If my other collections had people like Asta watching over them, I could take a hands-off approach.
VO_Archive_Herta_12.ogg  ||  I give her the most boring things, and then she gives them back to me and they're suddenly interesting.
VO_Archive_Herta_15.ogg  ||  Ruan Mei is a genius among geniuses — I won't deny that. I don't always get along with her, but I do admire her... Maybe the admiration is mutual.
VO_Archive_Herta_Eidolon_Activation.ogg  ||  Define inspiration? Tsk, it's only the several thousand ideas racing through my mind every minute.
VO_Archive_Herta_Character_Ascension.ogg  ||  You call that a build update?
VO_Archive_Herta_Max_Level_Reached.ogg  ||  Finally. Clocking off. Bye.
VO_Archive_Herta_Trace_Activation.ogg  ||  Happy? Word of advice: Don't expect too much from a puppet.
VO_Archive_Herta_Added_to_Team_With_Arlan.ogg  ||  Why the long face? I'm not going to eat you.
VO_Archive_Herta_Added_to_Team_With_Asta.ogg  ||  Asta! Here's the key. Gotta go now — bye.
VO_Archive_Herta_Added_to_Team_With_Himeko.ogg  ||  You know the drill — send me all your new toys, and I'll return them later.
VO_Archive_Herta_Added_to_Team_With_Ruan_Mei.ogg  ||  I don't usually get to see you outside the Simulated Universe. Who do you want to experiment on this time?
