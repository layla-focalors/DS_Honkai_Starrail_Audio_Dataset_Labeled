VO_Archive_Asta_1.ogg  ||  Hi, (Trailblazer)! The name's Asta, I'm the lead researcher on Herta Space Station. I'll be sure to let you know if I need your help... Don't worry, I think you'll be hearing from me.
VO_Archive_Asta_2.ogg  ||  *yawn* You're here! The observation matrix we adjusted should have some results for us now. Free to take a look?
VO_Archive_Asta_3.ogg  ||  Is that the time? Time flies when you're working hard.
VO_Archive_Asta_6.ogg  ||  *sigh* Even if I never kept in touch with any of my relatives, they would find their way over here.
VO_Archive_Asta_7.ogg  ||  You heard right! If I don't work hard, I'll have to go back and inherit the family fortune... *sigh*
VO_Archive_Asta_4.ogg  ||  ...I haven't written a single word yet... But it won't take long once I get started!
VO_Archive_Asta_5.ogg  ||  "The space station is merely Herta's toy box." That's by no means an inaccurate statement. But this is Herta we're talking about — her toys are pretty dangerous~
VO_Archive_Asta_8.ogg  ||  Continuously channeling funds into constructing the space station, improving employee benefits, creating a positive feedback loop... Ahem, as well as satisfying the lead researcher's — that is to say my — indispensable shopping needs.
VO_Archive_Asta_9.ogg  ||  If only Madam Herta could pay a visit to the space station more often — the researchers are clearly her followers.
VO_Archive_Asta_12.ogg  ||  When I first got to the space station, the researchers had prepared a room for me. I—I was really grateful, but it was far away from everyone else. That was a bit disheartening.
VO_Archive_Asta_13.ogg  ||  Even the monitoring room is being monitored.
VO_Archive_Asta_10.ogg  ||  Arlan's always saying stuff like, "all of you must heed Lead Researcher Asta's judgment!" Then when I remind him that that includes him, he says, "don't worry, I have my own judgment."
VO_Archive_Asta_11.ogg  ||  If there's anyone who thinks they can be as headstrong as Madam Herta, I'd recommend they consider whether or not they possess her intelligence first.
VO_Archive_Asta_14.ogg  ||  I can't solve every problem the Express Crew might have in their voyage across the galaxy, but if money's ever the solution, come find me.
VO_Archive_Asta_15.ogg  ||  The last time I spoke with Topaz, we agreed to take a holiday. We were going to charter a ship, go star-seeing, and catch up on all the IPC gossip... but we still haven't had the chance...
VO_Archive_Asta_16.ogg  ||  I asked Miss Ruan Mei where I could buy a charm like the one on her sleeve — but I was surprised to learn she'd hand-embroidered it. I was equally surprised when she gave me my own hand-embroidered charm the next time she came to the space station. Her craftsmanship, like her research papers, is superb.
VO_Archive_Asta_Eidolon_Activation.ogg  ||  Every star is a miracle!
VO_Archive_Asta_Character_Ascension.ogg  ||  The more I learn about it, the more I love the starry sky.
VO_Archive_Asta_Max_Level_Reached.ogg  ||  Goals are like the stars — we'll reach them eventually.
VO_Archive_Asta_Trace_Activation.ogg  ||  Another step closer to distant worlds.
VO_Archive_Asta_Added_to_Team_With_Arlan.ogg  ||  Arlan... don't carry the weight alone.
VO_Archive_Asta_Added_to_Team_With_Herta.ogg  ||  Oh! Madam Herta? We've got nothing to worry about.
VO_Archive_Asta_Added_to_Team_With_Topaz.ogg  ||  Topaz, what a coincidence! Guess I should see this as a business trip!
VO_Asta_Battle_Begins_-_Weakness_Break_01.ogg  ||  Hm. Scared yet?
VO_Asta_Battle_Begins_-_Danger_Alert_01.ogg  ||  Time to get vigilant.
VO_Asta_Turn_Begins_01.ogg  ||  A guest with no manners, huh?
VO_Asta_Turn_Begins_02.ogg  ||  I don't remember inviting you.
VO_Asta_Turn_Idling_01.ogg  ||  Guess what I'm about to do~
VO_Asta_Basic_ATK_01.ogg  ||  Look out~
VO_Asta_Skill_01.ogg  ||  Who's the lucky one today?
VO_Asta_Skill_02.ogg  ||  A gift from the stars~
VO_Asta_Hit_by_Light_Attack_01.ogg  ||  Ow ow ow...
VO_Asta_Hit_by_Heavy_Attack_01.ogg  ||  No, don't...
VO_Asta_Ultimate_-_Activate_01.ogg  ||  Everything is ordained by the stars.
VO_Asta_Ultimate_-_Unleash_01.ogg  ||  Oh profound secrets of the stars, give these Trailblazers your blessing!
VO_Asta_Downed_01.ogg  ||  But I want... to know more...
VO_Asta_Return_to_Battle_01.ogg  ||  That didn't count, let's go again!
VO_Asta_Health_Recovery_01.ogg  ||  Saving me won't earn you any favors.
VO_Asta_Technique_01.ogg  ||  Found your weakness~
VO_Asta_Battle_Won_01.ogg  ||  The stars will always remember us.
VO_Asta_Treasure_Opening_01.ogg  ||  Do I have this already?
VO_Asta_Precious_Treasure_Opening_01.ogg  ||  Definitely worth our while.
VO_Asta_Successful_Puzzle-Solving_01.ogg  ||  Progress~
VO_Asta_Enemy_Target_Found_01.ogg  ||  Might as well beat it up before it attacks me.
VO_Asta_Returning_to_Town_01.ogg  ||  Can you see the stars from here too?
