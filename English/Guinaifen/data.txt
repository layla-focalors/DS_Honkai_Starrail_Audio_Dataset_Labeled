VO_Archive_Guinaifen_1.ogg  ||  My name is Guinaifen, "Gui" means wood, "Nai" means to exist, and "Fen" means fragrant — rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it? I usually do juggling performances on this side of Exalting Sanctum. Remember to come see the show when you have the chance~
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_2.ogg  ||  Geez, why do I feel like I haven't seen you in a long time? What? You saw me yesterday? Ah — a day without seeing you feels like three years!
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_3.ogg  ||  See you next time! I'll save you a front-row seat. Oh, uh, it's a makeshift outdoor stand, "front-row" sounds a little fancy...
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_4.ogg  ||  My real name is Guinevere. Guinaifen is the Xianzhou name Shangshang gave me. Who is Shangshang you ask? She's my best friend — Sushang the Cloud Knight. Have you met her?
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_5.ogg  ||  I've got more than a dozen siblings! One of them is my older brother — he's also living on the Xianzhou. His name is Langshile, but he seems to prefer being called "Lancelot".
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_6.ogg  ||  I learned my juggling skills on the street — my brothers taught me. It started out as a way to survive. Who'd have thought the performances would become so popular? It feels like fate is teasing us sometimes, hehe.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_7.ogg  ||  This girl arrived on your Xianzhou ship and started juggling to earn her tips, melons and dates make a very nice meal, but to make my day needs at least ten strale, no need to waste time on idle chat, 'cause a real stage play is right where it's at!
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_8.ogg  ||  Don't you think the poetry and songs of the Xianzhou people are enchanting? One time I asked Shangshang to teach me to write poetry, and she only wrote four words in three months... I don't think I'll be able to learn at this rate.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_9.ogg  ||  There's so much good food on the Luofu, but for juggling one has to stay light and nimble. How does that ancient saying go... It's hard to be both loyal and filial? You can't serve two masters? Something like that?
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_10.ogg  ||  Sushang has been calling me "Little Gui" for a long time now, which is fine... But recently I've noticed that even my brothers on the street have started calling me "Little Gui", and even audience members... At this rate, no one's gonna remember my real name!
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_11.ogg  ||  On the Xianzhou, short-life species like us have a fleeting existence, here one moment and gone the next. That's all the more reason to seize the moment while you still have it!
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_12.ogg  ||  There's a crosstalk comedy duo in Exalting Sanctum — Forth and Back'n. They're a friendly couple of guys — they helped me to embellish a lot in my act. In fact, the doggerel portion of the performance was their idea.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_13.ogg  ||  Shangshang is my best friend. Aside from my street-performing brothers, she's the person I've known the longest on the Luofu. I wanted to become sworn sisters with her, but she didn't seem interested.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_14.ogg  ||  I heard that the general is interested in these street music performances. I wish I had the chance to perform at the Seat of Divine Foresight, then I could be famous.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_15.ogg  ||  I've never spoken to the general, but I did meet his retainer once. He asked me if I was a "woman of the sword", so you know what I did? I did a sword-swallowing performance right in front of him!
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_16.ogg  ||  Qingque likes to play celestial jade in Exalting Sanctum, but sometimes she gets tired and comes to see me juggling. I can tell from her face if she's won or lost that day — red is a win, pale is a loss, and really pale means her boss is out looking for her.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_17.ogg  ||  Isn't Huohuo's laugh just the cutest? My performances aren't scary — they're uplifting! I can't wait to see her laugh some more~
Special:Upload?wpDestFile=VO_Archive_Guinaifen_18.ogg  ||  "Living?" that's all a big hustle and bustle. But life? Life's all about savoring the moment.
VO_Archive_Guinaifen_22.ogg  ||  (Trailblazer), did you check out my latest livestream? It was a show-stopper!
VO_Guinaifen_Treasure_Opening_02.ogg  ||  Quick, snatch it all up!
